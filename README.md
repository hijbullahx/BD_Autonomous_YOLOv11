# Bangladesh-Adapted YOLOv11 for Autonomous Vehicles

## Thesis Overview
**Title:** A Bangladesh-Adapted YOLOv11 Object Detection Model for Improved Autonomous Vehicle Perception.

**Problem:** Standard models fail in Dhaka traffic due to unique vehicles (Rickshaw, CNG, Easy-bike) and extreme occlusion.
**Solution:** A custom YOLOv11 model trained on a localized dataset with occlusion-handling techniques.
